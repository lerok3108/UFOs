# UFOs
## Overview of the Project.
The purpose of this project was to create a webpage and dynamic table that would allow users to filter data in the table for multiple criteria at the same time, such as date, city, state, country, and shape.                                                   
## Results
Deliverable 1. The UFO Sightings web page

With help of HTML and JavaScript, the initial code provided in index.html file was modified to create various filters that allow users to filter data based on date, city, state, shape and country.

The original handClick() function was replaced with a new function that saves the element, value, and id of the filter that was changed. Then a new function was created to loop through the dataset and keep only the results that match the search criteria. 
## Drawbacks and Recommendations
One of the drawbacks of this page is that in order to search by date the exact date must be entered. One of the future development opportunities would be to give users possibility to enter just year to recieve a list of UFO sightings for that year. Furthemore, a heat map can be created to show where the majority of sightings were reported to potentially reveal some patterns that can be used for further analysis.
